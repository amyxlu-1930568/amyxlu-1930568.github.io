            <h2>Things I've Been Doing</h2>
            <p style="font-family:Cochin"> With classes ramping up, I haven't had a lot of time to work on anything partiularly fun but during 
                the spring break that just passed, I took on a couple hobbies. I started embroidering for the first 
                time and have been having a lot of fun with that. Although all my inspiration comes from Pinterest 
                at the moment, I hope to create some original work in the future. I also finally got some motivation and started 
                working out. I found that it's been very rewarding
                </p>
            <p style="font-family:Cambria">Some other hobbies of mine include tennis, baking and hiking. With quarantine, I haven't been going out (except 
                for my backyard) very much so I haven't had the chance to go hiking or play tennis with friends. However, I have 
                done some baking/cooking. I've been learning some reciepes to do when I return to school in the fall.
